# Gesture-Controlled-Call-SMS-Messaging
This project is a proof of concept that improves on mobile phone hands-free functionality while driving for accessibility. We were inspired for this project because older cars weren't made with hands-free tech included, and 3rd party voice-controlled hands-free tech never worked quite right in our experience. Also, it will allow for people unable to speak to control their phone safely while driving when getting an incoming call.
